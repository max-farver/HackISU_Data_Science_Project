# HackISU_Data_Science_Project
Data science project using data from the ISU registrar and an open dataset with average pay and emplyment rates of various majors.

There are three main parts of the project are:
1. Web scraper
2. Data Manipulation
3. Data Visualization

Our goal was to find data that actually feels relevant to the students represented here and to gain some insight into what majors give you the most "Bang for Your Buck".
